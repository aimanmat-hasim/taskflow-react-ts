# TaskFlow — Task Management App (React + TypeScript)

TaskFlow is a simple task management application built with **React, TypeScript, and Vite**.  
This project focuses on **clean state management, predictable data flow, and persistence logic**, rather than UI styling.

The goal of this project is to practice writing **solid frontend logic** and documenting decisions clearly.
